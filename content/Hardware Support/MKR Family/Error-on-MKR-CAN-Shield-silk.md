title: Error on MKR CAN Shield silk
id: 
---

An issue has been identified with the silk (the printed text and markings) on some Arduino MKR CAN Shield boards, where the bottom silk is mirrored. To avoid confusion, please use the top silk for reference (the top silk is on the side with the 4-pin CAN terminal). Specifically:

* `CANL` is located next to `-` (or `GND`).
* `CANH` is located next to `+` (or `VIN`).
